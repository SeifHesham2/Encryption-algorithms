## Overview

This project showcases various encryption algorithms, each contributing to the field of information security. Encryption is essential for securing sensitive data, and these algorithms play a crucial role in achieving that goal.

## Encryption Algorithms

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

- **Description:** AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm. It is known for its security and efficiency.

### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- **Description:** DES is a symmetric-key algorithm that was once a standard for government encryption.

### Caesar Algorithm

- **Description:** Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Columnar Algorithm

- **Description:** The Columnar Transposition Cipher involves writing the plaintext out in rows of a fixed length, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns.

### Diffie-Hellman Algorithm

- **Description:** Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm allowing two parties to securely generate a shared secret over an insecure communication channel.

### El-Gamal Algorithm

- **Description:** El-Gamal is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm used for secure communication.

### Extended Euclidean Algorithm

- **Description:** The Extended Euclidean Algorithm finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.

### Hill Cipher Algorithm

- **Description:** Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.

### Monoalphabetic Algorithm

- **Description:** Monoalphabetic ciphers use a single substitution alphabet for the entire message.

### Playfair Algorithm

- **Description:** Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters rather than single letters.

### Rail Fence Algorithm

- **Description:** Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that encrypts by rearranging the letters of the plaintext.
