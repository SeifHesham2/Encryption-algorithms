## AES

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency.

## DES

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm that was widely used for secure data transmission.

## DiffieHellman

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm allows two parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys over an insecure communication channel.

## ElGamal

The ElGamal encryption algorithm is an asymmetric key algorithm that provides both encryption and digital signature capabilities.

## MD5

The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.

## RC4

The RC4 algorithm is a widely used stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed.

## RSA

The RSA algorithm is a widely used asymmetric key algorithm for secure data transmission and digital signatures.
